How to run the app?
Open terminal > Navigate to the project folder > Inside that type:
python main.py

To run on localhost make these settings in main.py:
redis_host = "localhost"
redis_port = 6379
redis_password = ""

The application is working fine when run on the localhost but throwing error on deploying on cloud platforms.
